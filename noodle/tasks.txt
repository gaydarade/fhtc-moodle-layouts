Goal:
	Make Moodle look better, and bring it into a stylistic cohesion with fhtc.edu.
	Apparently that's not the case? Apparently we're making an entirely new webapp: a new student portal...???

1. Identify and select color schemes from moodle and FHTC.

	(Why not just rip this wholesale out of the CSS on fhtc? We have the technology...)

	/* all this junk is old, we're just gonna take styles off of fhtc.edu for starters */
	FHTC Theme -

		Background Colors:

		#003fa2 - header (blue)

		#e8bb51 - accents (gold)

		#101010 - fixed navba (charcoal)

		#efefef - main body background (off-white)
 
				#003da6 - header text (blue)

				#777 - body text (gray)

		#444444 - gray (footer)

				#efefef - link text (off-white)

				#777 - small footer text (gray)

	Moodle Theme -

		Moodle:
		just kidding moodle sucks, we're not gonna take anything from it.


2. Identify purpose of each page.

	Every Page - 
		Provides access to moodle profile/personal profile.
		Allows user to easily navigate through the rest of the site.

	Student Dashboard -
		Allows user to easily track and navigate to their classes.
		Moodle has calendars, messages, and other widgets that are just clutter.
			Throw them in the garbage?
		Should allow student to track the important stuff of their student life.
			Meaning:
			Enrolled Classes
			GPA
			Site Navigation?
			School Closings (this info probably emailed/texted to them)?
			Teacher Name & Contact info?
			Uhhhhhh..?
			idk, im not a very good student.
	Course categories -
		We absolutely need to have all of the categories.
		That's a given,
		Maybe drop downs that show courses or sub-categories?
 
	Courses -

		Basically just list all the courses in a given category, right?

3. Identify elements that appear on each page.


	Every Page - 
		header area
			Currently logged in student top right?
				Log out
		.breadcrumb nav under header?
	
	Student Dashboard -

		Default Elements:

		(necessary)	
		body area
			Student Navigation

			Course Overview


		
(junk nobody wants needs or uses)

		Private Files

		Latest Badges

		Upcoming Events



		(missing)

		grades for current courses

		current GPA

		courses: quick access
