INTEGRATION?????
(ESU - Banner
FHTC - Jenzabar
K-12 - Power School)
Manual Entry? Certainly not.

A web app should have integration points.
To reduce necessary integration points, funnel DB into JSON, into the webapp, and backward.
The JSON can be contained in an API, which can be used to play nice
with Software, Web, Device-type, just about anything.
